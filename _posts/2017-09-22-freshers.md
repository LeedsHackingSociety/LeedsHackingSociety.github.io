### Freshers Fair!
Hey Guys,
As you may have seen from our myriad of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts over the past couple of days, We have been at freshers fair!
It was so nice to meet everyone and we were overwhelmed by the positive comments we had and the amount of interest we received!

Our first meeting will be on the 28th of September we look forward to seeing you all there!

### Become a Member of Our Society!
As you may know your first two weeks are free of charge so you can get a feel for what we do and work out whether it is for you!
